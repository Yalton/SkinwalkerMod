I love how its actually in tune with skin walker lore. As when the kid acknowledged the screaming at the end, it suddenly began chasing them. In navoho lore im pretty sure that the big rule is do not acknowledge noises that walkers make, as they will know that you can hear them and they will come for you

According to their lore, the further away they sound the closer they are and vice versa. So after it chased him the first time and it sounded far away it actually wouldâ€™ve been much closer
